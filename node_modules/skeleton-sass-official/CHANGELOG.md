### 2.5.1

-   Fixes [issue #16](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/issues/16)

### 2.5.0

-   Addition of a new default theme called **fresh**
    _ Removal of old reset CSS in favor of [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
    _ Although, you can always use `reset.css` if you wish since it will still be part of the theme mixins!
    _ Adjustment of media queries
    _ **Note:** these media queries probably won't be perfect for _every_ project. Let the content dictate the media queries!
    _ Fluid grid is now the default with a fixed width set on the `body` element (you can change this behavior, of course)
    _ **Note:** the fixed grid will still be there! Difference is that the fluid grid will be the new default with the new theme only. You can still use the old `sphenoid` theme for the pre 2.5 setup (e.g. fixed grid, old skeleton.css theme, `reset.css`, etc.). \* New default font: [Raleway](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway)
-   Improvements with scripts and better compatibility with Ruby 2.x and better backward compatibility with Ruby 1.8+

###### Removals

-   `$colWidth` variable in the `@grid` mixin
-   Removed some sloppy code in the `@_offsets` mixin

###### Fixes/Changes

-   Plural `column` and `columns` for `one-third`, `two-third`, and `full-width`

###### New Features/Themes

-   `one-half` selector to grid
-   `$new` parameter to `@_fluidGrid` and `@_fixedGrid`. This makes some basic changes to the grid for the new Skeleton CSS format
-   Default fixed/fluid combo grid for `fresh` theme \* Updated offsets for the new fixed/fluid grid combo
-   Added new `offset-by-one-third`, `.offset-by-two-thirds`, and `.offset-by-one-half` selectors for new grid

### 2.0.0

###### Removals

-   Removed `$baseWidthMQ`
-   Removed `bourbon` and `compass` to completely flatten the dependency tree so all you need now is Sass 3.3+

###### Fixes/Changes

-   **Huge** changes to the structure of Skeleton Sass
-   No more camelCase variables (based on what we've seen the convention seems to prefer hyphens in variable names).
-   Squashed some old, lingering bugs with the gradient mixins
-   All of the logic has been moved to the `skeleton/core` folder
-   Completely removed `layout.scss` (media queries defined in the old layout file now live in `skeleton_template.scss`)
-   Fixed a few linger misspellings in a few selectors
-   Cleaned and optimized old mixins/functions
-   `$base-width` is now calculated automatically

###### New Features

-   Introduced global variables, mixins, and functions
-   Introduced a new concept to Skeleton Sass called _themes_. Themes allow you to edit the base styles to create a new launching platform for your projects. When you create a theme, it won't get overridden with an update to Skeleton Sass. [Learn more about themes here](https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass/wiki/Creating-a-theme).
-   Ruby scripts that help you setup Skeleton Sass for first time use, create themes, update Skleton Sass, and more
-   New functions and mixins:
    _ `_calcRU` is a function meant to be used in other functions. This function calculates the relative unit based on the `$base-font-size` and the `$size` passed into the function. These functions depend on `_calcRU`
    _ `em`
    _ `rem`
    _ `percent`
    _ `relative`
    _ `em` converts an absolute `px` unit to an `em` unit
    _ `rem` converts an absolute `px` unit to a `rem` unit
    _ `percent` converts an absolute `px` unit to a `%` unit
    _ `relative` converts an absolute `px` unit to the chosen relative unit as defined in `_config.scss` or your own project configuration.
    _ **Note:** if more than one relative unit is select then this function will simply spit out the `px` unit. // documentation is needed
    -   `@font-size` is a \*mixin\* that handles everything involving `font-size`. // TODO complete this
-   Added a grid generator helper in [atomicpages.github.io/skeleton-sass/](http://atomicpages.github.io/skeleton-sass/)
