I finally got around to making an actual site to host my portfolio and other bloggy-whatever things I wanted to post online that isn't just a splash page with my GitHub and LinkedIn on it!

In the near future, expect some blog posts about my existing projects under the "[Projects](@/pages/projects/_index.md)" page and random thoughts/updates/whateva under "[Blog](@/_index.md)" page.  If you're curious about how I spun this site up, [check out the first project post right here!](@/pages/projects/zola_blog/index.md).
